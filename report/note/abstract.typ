In this experiment, we make use of a lock-in amplifier to measure sub-milliohm resistance of a copper wire. To do this, we set up a two-probe measurement configuration where we pass a small AC current through the copper wire and measure the resulting voltage drop across it using the lock-in amplifier. We also characterize flicker noise (1/f noise) observed in resistors and compare it with theoretical estimates. We also detail the basic working principle of a lock-in amplifier in this report.
